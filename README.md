Arithmetic Game
#Arithmetic Game This is a basic arithmetic quiz game. When the game starts, a random arithmetic expression is generated using two random operands and one of four arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The player has to input the correct result of the expression within a certain time limit, which starts counting down from 30 seconds. If the player inputs the correct result, the score increases by 2 and a new expression is generated. If the player inputs an incorrect result, the number of tries decreases by 1. The game ends when the player inputs 3 incorrect results or the time runs out. The score is displayed along with the number of tries remaining. The game also keeps track of the high score and displays it in the game interface. The game also uses text-to-speech functionality to announce messages to the player during the game.
